Hey guys

Question:

1.What is Bitcoin doing that makes Bitcoin scalable?

Answer: 

Bitcoin has successfully implemented Segwit, a second layer technology which effectively doubles transaction throughput. 
As demand continues to increase, additional scaling solutions will be implemented, such as the Lightning Network. 
These projects are actively being refined and developed. Please review the current [Bitcoin Core Github repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects) for more information on active projects.

Question:

2.What is Bitcoin doing that makes Bitcoin fast?

Answer:

Some second layer technologies currently being developed will increase confirmation speeds, such as the Lightning Network. 
The Lightning Network is an open sourced project allowing frequent channels to be opened/closed with a small fee, and transactions
to flow within that channel at a fast rate and minimal cost. Please visit their [Github repository](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) for more information.

Question:

3.Segwit is already active. Why are my payments so slow and expensive? 

Answer:

Yes, Segwit is active but is a voluntary upgrade, hence the name of the Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 
type that helped it activate (Soft Fork). Due to the voluntary nature of Segwit, if the wallet or exchange you currently 
use to transfer your Bitcoins does not support Segwit technology, you will effectively not benefit from the lower transaction 
fees and speed of the Segwit upgrade. Segwit can work, but only if industry follows. For more adoption, please contact your product 
and service providers and urge them to support Segwit transactions. You can do this through creating suggestion and feedback tickets, 
and public reviews of their products. Or, support a product or service that allows for custom fees and Segwit support.

Question:

4.How long until Segwit is fully adopted?

Answer:

This depends on the industry and user adoption. Segwit is active and can be supported. Businesses will bend to the will of their 
clients. If you want Segwit for lower fees and faster transactions, please consider demanding it or switching to a product who 
supports it. 

Question:

5.Won’t bitcoin just get overtaken by Bitcoin Cash and everything else if there is no plan to make it fast and cheap? 

Answer:

As explained above, Bitcoin is actively pursuing safe and conservative solutions to a growing industry, but requires 
industry support to successfully implement such solutions to users. Bitcoin began as an experiment and though industry is now 
creating demand, Bitcoin as a project is only accountable to the peer review process and ensuring the security and functionality 
of its software. Though supporting user demand is important, it does not take priority above security and functionality. 


As for alternative coins and forks overtaking Bitcoin, it is conceivable. The cryptocurrency space is fully voluntary, so the success of each project is dependent on the willingness of the user to download and maintain the clients they choose. A good method for reviewing the success of each coin is seeing how each project is different from one another, such as reviewing the difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. What makes one better than the other? Reviewing the white papers, Github repositories, reviewing number of authors, proof type, and algorithms are important for understanding what each project is doing or proposing to do. In addition, reviewing the history of a currency and their project or company leads can help guide you to the best coin for you. See [the following](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/) as an example of crypto comparisons. 

Industry adoption, as it stands, seems to favor Bitcoin ([Japan, Russia](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/bitcoin-price-rises-japan-russia-regulation.html), 
[Sweden](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-swedish-authorities-have-settled-a-claim-in-bitcoins-2017-10/), 
[CME trading](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cf-bitcoin-reference-rate.html), and 
[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/payment/digital-currency.html)). 
However, this could change depending on demand and success of the development of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency project.

May the best project be successful!

Question:

6.Why is decentralization in Bitcoin important?

Answer:

Bitcoin was created in part because of the attack vector that centralized financial systems face on a regular basis. 
Centralized systems, such as credit card companies, banking systems, have led to disastrous outcomes when not treated responsibly 
(e.g. [2008 financial crisis](https://www.economist.com/news/schoolsbrief/21584534-effects-financial-crisis-are-still-being-felt-five-years-article)).
These disasters affect users at an alarming rate due to the flaw of having minimal points of failure. There are certainly 
advantages and disadvantages with each system, but in terms of financial security, the world has remained dependent on centralized 
institutions to act as custodians for user’s wealth. Bitcoin, a decentralized network of transaction verification and validation, 
allows for these points of failure to spread out, allowing for the safety of the transaction ledger to be untarnished. For more 
details on the differences between centralized and decentralized systems, please [click here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/network-support).

Question:

7.What about mining? Isn’t most of the mining done by just a few companies in China?

Answer:

Due to the complexity of mining equipment manufacturing and the raw materials sourced, many of the ASIC products are most 
accessible in China. However, mining is used to encrypt transaction information and does not verify the network. What is more 
decentralized in terms of proper storage of the transaction information are what’s called nodes, who’s purpose is to verify 
and confirm each transaction as it relates to the Blockchain. 

With Bitcoin proof-of-work systems, the miner’s role helps to secure Bitcoin transactions for monetary gain. This system does 
not incentivize miners to hold onto the Bitcoin, and the mining rewards can be used as leverage against the system. This is a more
fair and decentralized method of securing the network than say proof-of-stake, where the holder of the crypto is given incentive 
to continue holding as a encryption reward, creating a feedback loop. The voluntary nature of Bitcoin at every stage of its development 
also improves its decentralization. So, although it is true that much of the mining is currently done in China at this time, the 
centralized mining does not compromise the decentralized network of Bitcoin, and competitors of mining hardware can develop at any 
given moment.

What is more urgent is the continued decentralization of the node system, which can be maintained through small node requirements (1mb block sizes). The larger the block limit, the more difficult it is for the average person to run a node.

Question:

8.I heard the Bitcoin Core development team is financed by bankers and nefarious entities. What gives?

Answer:

Bitcoin Core has the most diverse and decentralized team in the cryptocurrency space. This can be reviewed through each project’s 
Github repository. Bitcoin Core is a voluntary space where individuals or teams may submit commit and pull requests from the project. 
Each request undergoes what is called a ‘[peer review process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review)’, which is an 
academic and scientific process to filter out for the best content and reveal logical fallacies or breaks. Some Core developers are 
financed by private entities, yet others are not financed at all, and still others are students from reputable Universities. It is 
arguably the case that other projects has much higher centralization in terms of project development than Bitcoin Core. Some 
cryptocurrency projects have identifiable individuals who claim to own the ‘company’ or project. If decentralization is important to 
you, it is important to stay consistent with this vision in all aspects of the project.

Question:

9.I also heard that Bitcoin requires a lot of energy to exist. What if another coin cuts energy consumption?

Answer:

Though it is true that Bitcoin requires energy to run the mining as well as the nodes, it is a fragment compared to the energy and 
resource expenditure of existing global industry, such as the mining of ore, the maintenance of golf courses across the world, logging, 
palm oil cultivation and extraction, and the current point-of-sale and banking systems. The emergence of this argument may present a 
red herring to the overall narrative of Bitcoin as an alternative to the legacy financial system since many other industries induce or 
create more harmful effects overall. 

In addition, second layer technologies may prove helpful to mitigate the concerns of energy consumption.
